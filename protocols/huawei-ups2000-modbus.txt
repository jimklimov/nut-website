= Support of Huawei UPS2000 1/2/3KRT (Modbus RTU)

Based on link:https://support.huawei.com/enterprise/en/doc/EDOC1000110696[Huawei UPS2000 (1 kVA-3 kVA) Modbus Protocol Development Guide]

== Querying Registers

[NOTE]
======
* All values are stored as `U16`
* Gain: the value read out must divide this value
* Type: the data type AFTER applying the gain
* Example:
  - Voltage reading from the register is `2262`
  - Gain is `10`
  - Type is `Real`
  - => actual Voltage = 226.2
* All register address may add UPS ID multiplied by 10000.
  However when using on-device serial port, the UPS ID is *1* fixed.
  *Querying only with register address without the UPS ID also works
  when there is only one device.*
  - e.g. Address of Input Voltage register is 1000
  - UPS ID is 1
  - => Register ID used to send request is 11000 (0x2AF8), or 1000 (0x03E8)
* All reserved bits in bit flags shall be 0 unless noticed otherwise.

== Controlling Registers

[NOTE]
======
* Type *Bool* means write 0 to disable the function and write 1 to enable unless noticed otherwise.
* Type *Exec* means write 1 to execute the function unless noticed otherwise.
