- Mar 28, 2025: link:http://wmnut.networkupstools.org[WMNut] 0.71 released, addressing compatibility with C23, adding new `ups.status` token support, and revising some documentation and recipes
- Feb 28, 2025: with link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/pull/2825[NUT PR #2825] merged, a technologically and practically interesting revamp of NUT mesh of link:https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/[automake] (`Makefile.am`) recipes was completed, allowing for a more parallelizable build routine on multi-CPU machines, utilizing more cores and completing in less "wall-clock" time that the standard `SUBDIRS` driven approach. It is not a radical rewrite like some other projects suggest, and so retains the general structure and certain benefits and flexibility of that standard approach, including developer build workflows with a bespoke `Makefile` in every significant directory. Overall, NUT CI farm build times got 25%+ shorter (which is important as some scenarios had hit the 1-hour timeout imposed by providers of free CI hosting), and we suppose this is an interesting case for other projects to draw inspiration from for their recipe refactoring.
- Nov 6, 2024: due to update of NUT CI farm's Jenkins core, numerous build agent configurations and OSes had to be updated to use JDK17+. NUT documentation for build prerequisites and CI setup was accordingly updated.
- Aug 12, 2024: link:http://wmnut.networkupstools.org[WMNut] 0.70 released, addressing some warnings found by newer compilers and updating code style, documentation and recipes
- Mar-Jul, 2024: much work was done about up-streaming code developed by Eaton as part of link:https://42ity.org[42ITy(TM) project] and related efforts, and expanding NUT CI farm testing (and recipe/code abilities) on MacOS with Homebrew (x86, arm), all due to be part of NUT v2.8.3 release
- Apr 1, 2024: NUT v2.8.2 released
- Nov 15, 2023: following up with link:https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d2fbf2b9e082&utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&utm_medium=Referral_Program&utm_source=badge[DigitalOcean] sponsorship for FOSS compute resource hosting after some hiatus on the NUT CI side (too many plans, too little time)
- Nov 9, 2023: the PyNUT module provided in NUT sources is now published as `PyNUTClient` by CI to https://pypi.org/project/PyNUTClient (release snapshots) and https://test.pypi.org/project/PyNUTClient/ (rolling master-branch revisions). Hopefully, `pip` would have easier time finding it now to help create NUT clients.
- Oct 31, 2023: NUT 2.8.1 released
  * ERRATA: Please check link:https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/pull/2155[NUT PR #2155] for a possible segmentation fault fix with INSTCMD processing
  * ERRATA: in `nut-scanner` results, `apc_modbus` can be suggested even if you lack a `libmodbus` version with USB support; try `usbhid-ups` instead then
- Oct 20, 2023: a very long-awaited feature is now delivered, an APC Modbus capable NUT driver `apc_modbus` (due to be part of NUT v2.8.1 release)
  * NOTE: As of this publication, the upstream `libmodbus` project lacks the needed support for USB; a fork is available and PR to upstream is pending.
- Oct 3, 2023: thanks to generous FOSS project support from link:https://gandi.net/[Gandi.net], NUT DNS hosting costs are now handled by them
- Sep 18, 2023: access to interactive NUT CI farm resources now requires a logged-in session (web scrapers overwhelmed it)
- Sep 12, 2023: NUT documentation was restructured, in particular, from now on the current codebase provides `INSTALL.nut.adoc`, `NEWS.adoc` and `UPGRADING.adoc` files (with `.adoc` extensions) so older URLs pointing to files without these extensions may have got obsoleted. This change allows IDEs (including GitHub Web UI) to render most of the markup automagically. Also, a recipe and artifact for `release-notes.pdf` is now provided.
  * Important note: "Chunked HTML" documentation format generation was changed to produce HTML file names based on chapter title, not cryptic enumeration-based file names. This may help with long-term stability of URLs in blogs, etc. (chapter numbers did change over time). Existing "cryptic" filenames were aliased to new ones, but eventually will be deprecated.
- Sep 1, 2023: link:http://wmnut.networkupstools.org[WMNut] 0.69 released, updated for NUT 2.8.0 API compatibility and with revised documentation, CI checks, and build recipes
- Aug 3, 2023: revised the mark-up language and contents for NUT DDL (Devices Dumps Library) data files, so the generated pages should now expose much more structured information that was "hidden" there for years
- May 31, 2023: published maintainer GPG key, `DE0184DA7043DCF7: public key "Jim Klimov (Doing FOSS since last millennium) <jimklimov@gmail.com>"` and updated metadata for past NUT v2.8.0 release
- Feb 2, 2023: signed up for fiscal hosting with Open Source Collective at https://opencollective.com/networkupstools/ and GitHub sponsors program at https://github.com/sponsors/networkupstools
- late 2022/early 2023: re-affirmed NUT portability goal that new releases should build and run at least wherever old ones worked, by making sure it still works on CentOS 6, Debian 7 and Solaris 8 (yes, there are users who still run them!)
- Dec 7, 2022: confirmed link:https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d2fbf2b9e082&utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&utm_medium=Referral_Program&utm_source=badge[DigitalOcean] sponsorship for FOSS compute resource hosting
- Sep 3, 2022: codebase of the NUT for Windows branch was merged to main codebase, not in the least to avoid bit-rot and need for re-synchronisation with merge conflicts that regularly arose as they co-existed. More community work is needed to complete some drivers' functionality and MSI package delivery, but for many use-cases it may already "just work".
- Aug 18, 2022: efforts to revive NUT for Windows development (active since spring 2022) have reached the stage of regular CI builds on AppVeyor in semi-native environment (Windows with MSYS2/MinGW x64); regular cross-builds with Linux+MinGW environment were activated earlier
- Aug 10, 2022: "UPS management protocol", Informational RFC 9271 published by IETF at https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9271 and the IANA port number registry was updated at https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=3493 (even though this RFC is not formally an Internet Standard)
- May 10, 2022: added free layer of CircleCI to the ecosystem of NUT builders, to cover MacOS and later maybe Windows
- Apr 26, 2022: NUT 2.8.0 released
- Apr 24, 2022: a "dress rehearsal" for new release issuing NUT 2.8.0-rc3, focusing on documentation and API updates to impact the ecosystem just once
- Apr 10, 2022: preparing for new release by issuing NUT 2.8.0-rc2, fixing found bugs, adding late-coming features, and rehearsing some automation involved
- Apr 7, 2022: nut-website repository integrated with NUT CI farm to enable regular documentation updates as NUT code development and DDL get refreshed. Users of official "historic" releases which are the basis for distribution packaging have the new sub-sites frozen in time.
- Apr 1, 2022: preparing for new release by issuing NUT 2.8.0-rc1
- Feb 5, 2022: main nut-website regenerated to follow iterative development of NUT features more closely
- Feb 4, 2022: nut-website repository rearranged to allow publishing sub-sites with historic NUT releases (to help users of distributed packages configure their deployments); published v2.7.4
- Feb 4, 2022: nut-ddl repository gets rudimentary CI to avoid not-parsable device dump filenames
- Jan 12, 2022: completed the merge of libusb-1.0 related branches into main NUT codebase
- Jan 10, 2022: added GitHub pull request templates for nut and nut-ddl to help people post better contributions
- early Jan 2022: NUT CI farm migrated to a different datacenter from sponsors of Fosshost
- May 23, 2021: complementary projects led by Roger Price now hosted in
